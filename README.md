# ML-Stock_Price_Movement_Prediction
An interesting project that we did in school for our Introduction to Machine Learning class, where we made use of typical ensemble methods, LSTM and CNN to predict stock price movement. Refer to our [full report](https://github.com/Tay-Jie-Wen-Marcus/ML-Stock_Price_Movement_Prediction/) for all the details.


## Note:
As the main objective of the project was to evaluate various techniques used in stock price movement prediction, some of the code for our models were extracted from public repository/reports/articles that we referenced in our report. Who do not own those and credit belongs to its respective owners as referenced to in our report.
